# Real-Time Weapon Detection Using YOLOv8

This project is a real-time weapon detection system built using **YOLOv8**, **OpenCV**, and **PyTorch**.  
It can detect weapons (such as guns and knives) from live webcam feed or video files and raise an alert whenever a weapon is detected.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time detection of weapons using **YOLOv8**.
- Supports **webcam**, **video files**, or **image** inputs (depending on how you run the script).
- Visual bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores.
- **Alarm sound** (`alarm.mp3`) when a weapon is detected.
- Multiple ways to run:
  - GUI-based application (`guiapp.py`)  
  - Terminal-based detection (`weapon_detect_terminal.py`)
- Custom trained model weights (`best.pt`) based on YOLOv8.
